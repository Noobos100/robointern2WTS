# robointern2WTS

A simple program written in Python that allows you to convert an array of tasks from RoboIntern to an array of tasks for the Windows Task Scheduler.

## How it works

In python, call the copyxml function with:
- the WTS file (single task) as a template for the first argument
- the RoboIntern configfile (taskarray) as the second argument
